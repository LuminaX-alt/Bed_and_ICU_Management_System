# Bed_and_ICU_Management_System
In a modern healthcare environment, efficient bed and ICU management is critical for ensuring timely patient care and resource optimization. To enhance real-time communication and responsiveness, integrating an automated alert system using Twilio’s SMS API provides a reliable way to notify hospital administrators or medical staff about critical bed availability.

Twilio is a cloud communications platform that enables programmatic sending of SMS messages through its API. By integrating Twilio into the AI-based bed and ICU management system, the platform can automatically send SMS notifications under certain conditions — such as when the number of available ICU beds falls below a critical threshold. This instant alert helps medical staff take immediate actions to accommodate new patients or prepare for transfers, thereby minimizing delays and improving patient outcomes.

The implementation involves securely storing Twilio credentials (Account SID, Auth Token) and configuring the system to trigger SMS alerts via the Twilio API. These alerts provide concise, timely information directly to the administrator’s mobile device, bridging the communication gap between the AI system and human decision-makers.

Overall, Twilio SMS integration increases the robustness and real-world utility of the bed management system, facilitating proactive healthcare delivery in dynamic hospital settings.
